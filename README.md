# Final-Project-ICS4UR
This project is a 2d mini golf game based on the iphone GamePigeon golf game. We came up with 4 potential options but the group unanimously believed that this option had the potential to cover the required concepts with the most flexibility. We initially used 2 AI prompts to come up with a skeleton code before modifying and improving upon that code. This project shows our understanding of the concepts of class with our use of java swing,mouse/event handling, inheritance and other concepts while also giving us an entertaining game that came from the fruits of our labor.
